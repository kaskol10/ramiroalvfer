This talk was part of the DevFest Spain 2020. The aim of this talk was to review how we can develop apps from our localhost using Kubernetes in localhost, we check how to use Minikube, Rancher K3d and Kind, besides we check how to provision cloud resources without cloud. Using Cloud Emulators would be possible, and we try to do it in AWS - Localstack and in GCP using GCP Emulator.

You can follow the talk in Youtube or if you want to check the source, you can review the GitHub repo too.
