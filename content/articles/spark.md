In this post, I'd like to share my repository about how to deploy Spark using the different cloud providers as well as how to be able to orchestrate the jobs using a native solution for AWS, GCP or Azure.

This post was presented in Google DevFest Asturias 2019, you can check the talk in Youtube or if you prefer going deep, you can review the GitHub repo too.
